Just my dotfiles :)

here is a quick guide:

Step1: Open a terminal 

Step2:git clone https://github.com/p978/not-available.git

Step3: cd not-available

step4: ./install_i3_config

wait before u close this tab you yea you need to do some steps because i was too lazy to write that in the script 

open file manager 

open not-available directory and go to fonts in not-available directory copy all the files execpt index.html

now go to .fonts directory where u may ask figure it out ur self

paste the files in .fonts directory

i just noticed that install file is not executable so here is the command to make it executable and u need to be in the not-available directory
chmod +x ./install_the_config

ah this is gonna be the most cringiest repo

Done!
